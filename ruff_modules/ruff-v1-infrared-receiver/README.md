# Infrared Receiver Driver

This module can be used to receive infrared signals.

## Supported Engines

* Ruff: >=1.2.0 <2.0.0

## Supported Models

- [irr-01](https://rap.ruff.io/devices/irr-01)

## Installing

Execute following command and enter a **supported model** to install.

```sh
# Please replace `<device-id>` with a proper ID.
# And this will be what you are going to query while `$('#<device-id>')`.
rap device add <device-id>

# Then enter a supported model, for example:
# ? model: irr-01
```

## Usage

Here is the basic usage of this driver.

```js
$('#<device-id>').on('data', function(data) {
    console.log('received data', data);
});
```

## FAQ

If you use this driver under `Ruff: 1.2.0`, you should to press the `HRESET` button to reboot the RuffOS after deploying your application.

The data that is emitted by this driver is hard to be understood.

It is recommended to use Infrared Receiver(`IRR-01`) to receive data and forward the data to Infrared Transmitter(`IRT-01`).

## API References

### Events

#### `data`

Emits on valid infrared signals received, calls the listener with the data received.
And the data emitted is an array of numbers that represent time spans (in μs) of high-level and low-level signals.

A high-level time span is ORed with `0x01000000`.
For example, if a high-level signal lasts 500 (`0x000001f4`) μs, the correspondent signal number is then `0x010001f4`.
